  title: Google Cloud Pub/Sub API Test IAM Permission
  description: |-
    Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
    If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
    permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

    Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
    UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
    may "fail open" without warning.
